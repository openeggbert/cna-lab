/**
 * @file CNA/Editor/Assets/AssetDatabase.hpp
 * @brief Stable identity, import settings and dependency tracking for a project's assets.
 *
 * The central rule is that **nothing references an asset by path** (ANALYSIS.md decision D-08).
 * A scene stores a Uuid; the database maps that Uuid to whatever path the file currently has.
 * Moving `Assets/player.png` into `Assets/Characters/` then costs nothing -- no scene is touched,
 * no reference breaks, and the move produces a one-line diff in a sidecar file instead of a
 * hundred-line diff across every scene that used the texture.
 *
 * The identity lives in a `.cnaasset` sidecar next to the source file, so it survives the source
 * being edited by an external tool, and so it can be committed to git alongside the art.
