/**
 * @file CNA/Editor/Panels/EditorPanel.hpp
 * @brief The base a panel derives from, and the editor operations it may invoke.
 *
 * Panels were methods on EditorApplication through Phase 0, which was right while there was barely
 * a panel to speak of. They are classes now (plan.md ED-210): each owns its own view state --
 * which component the inspector's Add picker is showing, which row the hierarchy is renaming,
 * how the console is filtered -- and none of it is visible to the others.
 *
 * What a panel may *do* to the editor goes through EditorActions rather than through a back
 * reference to the application. That keeps the surface deliberately narrow, and it keeps one rule
 * enforceable: an operation reachable from a panel, from the menu bar and from a keyboard shortcut
 * must be the same operation. A panel that reimplemented "delete the selection" slightly
 * differently is a bug users report as "undo is broken".
