 *
 * Discovery is a first-class part of this, not a detail. Because CNA fixes its backend at compile
 * time (ANALYSIS.md finding F-01), "run the game on the Software backend" means "launch
 * `cna-player-software`", and whether that binary exists is a question with a real answer. The
 * editor offers the user only the backends it can actually find, rather than a menu of fourteen
 * entries of which two work.
