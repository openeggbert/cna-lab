/**
 * @file CNA/Editor/Ui/EditorUi.hpp
 * @brief The toolkit-independent UI surface every panel is written against.
 *
 * No panel, command or plugin may call Dear ImGui -- or Qt, or anything else -- directly. They
 * call this interface, and exactly one implementation binds it to a real toolkit (ANALYSIS.md
 * decision D-02). The cost is one indirection per widget, which is irrelevant at editor frame
 * rates. The benefit is threefold:
 *
 * 1. the toolkit choice stays reversible after the editor has real panels in it;
 * 2. the whole panel layer is unit-testable against NullEditorUi, with no window and no GPU;
 * 3. a plugin compiled against this header keeps working across a toolkit change.
 *
 * The interface is deliberately immediate-mode, because that is the cheaper direction to adapt:
 * wrapping a retained toolkit (Qt) in an immediate-mode facade is routine, while the reverse
 * requires inventing state the immediate-mode toolkit never had.
