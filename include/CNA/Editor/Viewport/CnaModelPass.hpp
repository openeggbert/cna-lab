/**
 * @file CNA/Editor/Viewport/CnaModelPass.hpp
 * @brief Draws imported models as solid, lit geometry through CNA's public API (plan.md ED-402).
 *
 * The CNA half of ED-402. What to draw was decided in `cna-editor-scene`
 * (`SceneModels.hpp`) where CI can check it with no device; this uploads that decision and issues
 * the draw calls. Four things are decided *here*, because each is about the device rather than
 * about the document.
 *
 * **1. `PbrEffect` where the build has one, `BasicEffect` where it does not.** The owner chose PBR
 * with a fallback, and the fallback is not defensive programming for its own sake: `PbrEffect` is
 * `NOXNA`, a CNA extension, and this editor supports fourteen backends of three support tiers
 * (F-02). The effect is constructed once and the choice reported through `ModelPassStats::effect`
 * so the Diagnostics panel can say which one a build actually got -- "why does it look different
 * on this machine" deserves an answer that is not a screenshot comparison.
 *
 * **2. The render target needs a depth buffer, and the 2D one has none.** `CnaSceneRenderer`'s
 * target is created with the two-argument `RenderTarget2D` constructor, which is documented as
 * "no depth buffer" -- correct for sprites, which sort by draw order, and useless for models,
 * which sort per pixel. Without one a crate renders with its back faces punched through its front.
 * So the 3D view asks for a target *with* depth, and the renderer recreates the target when the
 * requirement changes rather than keeping two.
 *
 * **3. Cull counter-clockwise faces -- which is right *because* of the Y mirror, not despite it.**
 * The importer winds triangles counter-clockwise seen from outside, in world space
 * (`meshWindingMatchesNormals`). The view-projection then mirrors Y, and mirroring one axis
 * reverses apparent winding, so an outward-facing triangle arrives at the rasteriser clockwise --
 * which `CullCounterClockwiseFace`, XNA's own default, keeps. Two reversals that cancel is exactly
 * the kind of reasoning that is worth writing down and then *checking*, so the constant below is
 * one line to change and the screenshot in NEXT.md is what confirms it.
 *
 * **4. Buffers are cached per model asset, never per entity.** Ten crates are one vertex buffer
 * drawn ten times with ten world matrices. Keyed by `Uuid` for the reason D-08 gives everywhere
 * else: an asset that moves keeps its id.
