/**
 * @file CNA/Editor/Viewport/CnaSceneRenderer.hpp
 * @brief Draws a scene document into an offscreen texture, through CNA's public API.
 *
 * The counterpart to CnaUiRenderer: that one draws the editor's *chrome*, this one draws the
 * *content*. Both go through `Microsoft::Xna::Framework::*` only.
 *
 * Rendering to a `RenderTarget2D` rather than straight to the back buffer is what lets the result
 * appear as an image inside a docked ImGui panel — the viewport is a panel like any other, and the
 * user can move, resize and tab it. It also means the scene is drawn at exactly the panel's size,
 * so nothing is stretched.
 *
 * The passes are kept separate and ordered, per ANALYSIS.md's adoption of the original design:
 * grid, then the game's own content, then the editor's overlay. Editor artefacts — grid lines,
 * selection outlines, icons, gizmos — are never entities in the scene, so a build can never ship
 * with them.
