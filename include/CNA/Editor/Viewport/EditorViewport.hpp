/**
 * @file CNA/Editor/Viewport/EditorViewport.hpp
 * @brief The scene preview surface, and the seam where CNA is allowed to appear.
 *
 * This is the **only** module in the editor that may link CNA. Everything else -- the document
 * model, the undo stack, the asset database, the panels -- is CNA-free, which is what lets the
 * editor build and its tests run with no CNA checkout, no window and no GPU (ANALYSIS.md
 * decision D-03).
 *
 * The interface is deliberately coarse: one `render()` call that returns a texture id the panel
 * can display. An earlier draft exposed the passes individually (`renderGrid`, `renderScene`,
 * `renderSelectionOutline`, …) and that turned out to be the wrong seam -- the *ordering* of those
 * passes is a property of the renderer, not a decision for the panel, and every implementation
 * would have had to be trusted to call them in the right order. The ordering still matters and is
 * still enforced; it is simply enforced in one place now, inside the implementation.
 *
 * Note what is absent: the camera lives in `cna-editor-scene` as `EditorCamera2D`, not here.
 * Picking, framing and grid spacing all need it, and none of those should require a CNA build.
