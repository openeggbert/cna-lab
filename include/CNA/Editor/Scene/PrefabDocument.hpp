/**
 * @file CNA/Editor/Scene/PrefabDocument.hpp
 * @brief A `.cnaprefab`: one reusable entity subtree, and the link an instance keeps to it.
 *
 * plan.md ED-300. A prefab stores its entities in exactly the shape a scene stores its own
 * (`EntityJson.hpp`), and it has to: an instantiated prefab and a hand-authored entity must be
 * indistinguishable once they are in a scene, or the same entity would round-trip differently
 * depending on where it came from.
 *
 * **Overrides are computed, not stored.** The scene file holds the instance's actual values, the
 * way it holds every other entity's, and "what has this instance changed?" is answered by comparing
 * it against the prefab. Storing an override list would mean two descriptions of the same fact,
 * free to disagree -- and the disagreement shows up as a property that reverts to a value the user
 * never chose, which is the single worst thing a prefab system can do. It also means no new
 * serialised structure at all: a scene written before prefabs existed is still a valid scene.
 *
 * What an instance *does* store is the link: the id of the prefab asset on the instance root, and
 * on every entity of the instance the id of the prefab entity it came from. Both live in
 * `editorState`, because they are editor bookkeeping rather than something the game runs (D-07).
