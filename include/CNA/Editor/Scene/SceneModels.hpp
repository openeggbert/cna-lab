/**
 * @file CNA/Editor/Scene/SceneModels.hpp
 * @brief What the 3D view should draw solid, decided without a GPU (plan.md ED-402).
 *
 * The same shape as `SceneWireframe.hpp` and for the same reason: *which* models to draw, *where*,
 * and *lit by what* are decisions, and decisions belong in this CNA-free module where CI can check
 * them with no device. The viewport is handed a finished list and does nothing but upload and
 * draw it.
 *
 * That split is what makes ED-402 testable at all. A model pass written straight into the
 * viewport could only be verified by looking at a screenshot, and the things most likely to be
 * wrong -- the world matrix, which mirror is applied, whether an entity is lit from the right
 * side -- are all arithmetic that a test can pin exactly.
 *
 * **The one convention that must not drift**, and the reason this file names it twice: the
 * view-projection here is `EditorCamera3D::getViewProjectionMatrix()`, the *same* matrix the
 * wireframe, the picker and the gizmos already go through, and it already contains the Y mirror
 * that converts XNA's Y-up 3D frame to this editor's Y-down world. A model pass that mirrored
 * again would draw models upside down relative to the grid and the gizmos around them; one that
 * built its own matrix would drift from what a user can click on. Neither is theoretical -- both
 * are the first two ways this task can go wrong.
