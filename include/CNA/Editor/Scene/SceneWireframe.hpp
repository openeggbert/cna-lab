/**
 * @file CNA/Editor/Scene/SceneWireframe.hpp
 * @brief What the 3D viewport draws, expressed as screen-space line segments (plan.md ED-400).
 *
 * The same split the gizmos use, and for the same reason: the *decisions* -- where the ground grid
 * goes, how far it extends, which entity gets a box, what is clipped against the near plane -- are
 * CNA-free and unit-tested in CI, and the renderer's job shrinks to calling `drawLine` in a loop.
 * A 3D viewport whose geometry could only be checked by looking at it would be a 3D viewport
 * nobody could check.
 *
 * This is deliberately *not* a 3D renderer. Until ED-402 brings a model pipeline there is no mesh
 * to draw, and a wireframe over the scene's bounds answers the question a 3D camera exists to ask:
 * where is everything, actually, in relation to everything else. Sprites are not drawn as textured
 * quads here because `SpriteBatch` cannot draw an arbitrary quad -- only a rotated rectangle -- and
 * a sprite seen from an angle is a trapezoid.
