/**
 * @file CNA/Editor/Core/EditorMatrix.hpp
 * @brief A 4x4 matrix and the transforms a 3D viewport is built from.
 *
 * Mirrors `Microsoft::Xna::Framework::Matrix` field for field, for the same reason every type in
 * `EditorMath.hpp` does (ANALYSIS.md D-03): cna-editor-core links nothing from CNA, so a camera
 * built on this is unit-testable with no window, no GPU and no CNA checkout, and the conversion in
 * cna-editor-viewport stays a field copy.
 *
 * **Conventions, all of them XNA's.** Storage is row-major (`M11`..`M44`, translation in the fourth
 * *row*), vectors are rows and multiply on the left (`v * M`), so `multiply(a, b)` means "a, then
 * b". The projections are **right-handed**, matching `Matrix::CreatePerspectiveFieldOfView` and
 * `CreateLookAt`, which is what a game passing these to `BasicEffect` will already be using: a
 * camera that agreed with itself but not with the runtime would show the scene mirrored the moment
 * anyone pressed Play.
 *
 * Depth maps to [0, 1] at the near and far planes respectively, again as XNA does, rather than
 * OpenGL's [-1, 1]. Nothing here rasterises anything, but the clip-space rule has to be stated
 * somewhere or the screen conversions below cannot be checked against anything.
